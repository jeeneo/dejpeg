## what is this app for?

this app is designed to remove image compression, noise, or other unpleasant artifacts

note: this isn't "AI" or image upscaling, your images stay the same resolution.
It's meant to provide a cleaner image, which can produce better results if you do use "AI enhancers", but that can make them look uglier or create unpleasant artifacts/blending (my opinion), see the wiki page for [2x++ models when???](https://github.com/jeeneo/dejpeg/wiki/model-requests#2x-models-when) on GitHub for more information.
